# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an example app created with [Expo](https://expo.dev) for the blog post ["Creating Stunning Gradients in React Native with Skia"](XXX). 
In this blog post I show how you can create some beautiful texts and shape with gradients using React Native Skia.


## Get started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app

```bash
 npx expo start
```

NB.: the app uses some custom fonts loaded with `expo-font` plugin. To check the complete example run one of the commands below to create a native build

```bash
npm run ios
npm run android
```
